Currently: Experimentation. Iteration. Learning.  

## Why Reinvent the Wheel? 
I need to learn, you ass. Additionally, I'm firmly under the impression that not all of the needs of this platform will be met by any single solution.

### GLOSSARY
**Blank Node**: Local identifiers for unnamed nodes in RDF graphs that are used in some concrete RDF syntaxes or RDF store implementations. The identifiers for Blank Nodes are not part of the RDF abstract syntax, but are entirely dependent on particular concrete syntax or implementation (such as Turtle, JSON-LD).  

**BNode**: Short for Blank Node.  

**Entity**:  

**Fact**: (Triple, Statement)

**N-Triples**:  
**N-Quads**:  
**Namespace**:  
**Namespace Name**:  
**Node**:  
**Object**:  

**Predicate**: IRIs that can be interpreted as either a relationship between the two nodes or as defining an attribute value (object node) for some subject node.  

**Prefix**:  
**Quad**:  
**RDF**:  
**RDFS**:  


**Resource**: used in triples (or statements, facts) to form knowledge relationships. A resources is represented in the form of an IRI (or URI).
