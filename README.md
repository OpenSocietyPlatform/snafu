Currently: Experimentation. Iteration. Learning.  

## Why Reinvent the Wheel? 
I need to learn, you ass. Additionally, I'm firmly under the impression that not all of the needs of this platform will be met by any single solution.

### GLOSSARY-FULL [Scoped] 
**Blank Node**: Local identifiers for unnamed nodes in RDF graphs that are used in some concrete RDF syntaxes or RDF store implementations. The identifiers for Blank Nodes are not part of the RDF abstract syntax, but are entirely dependent on particular concrete syntax or implementation (such as Turtle, JSON-LD). Unlike IRIs and literals, blank nodes do not identify specific resources. Statements involving blank nodes say that something with the given relationships exists, without explicitly naming it.  

**BNode**: Short for Blank Node.

**Node**:

**Predicate**: IRIs that can be interpreted as either a relationship between the two nodes or as defining an attribute value (object node) for some subject node.  

**Prefix**:  
**Quad**:  
**RDF**:  
**RDFS**:  

**Referent**: Another word for a resource denoted by an IRI.  

**Resource**: Anything can be a resource, including physical things, documents, abstract concepts, numbers and strings; the term is synonymous with "entity" as it is used in the RDF Semantics specification [RDF11-MT](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#bib-RDF11-MT). It is used in triples (or statements, facts) to form knowledge relationships. A resources is represented in the form of an IRI (or URI).

**Statement**: Asserting an RDF triple says that some relationship, indicated by the predicate, holds between the resources denoted by the subject and object. This statement corresponding to an RDF triple is known as an RDF statement. The predicate itself is an IRI and denotes a property, that is, a resource that can be thought of as a binary relation. (Relations that involve more than two entities can only be [indirectly expressed in RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/) [[SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS]](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#bib-SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS).)
